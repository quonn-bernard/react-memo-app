## This is App 1 of 10 for the month of October!
I believe that the best way to "bake-in" new concepts is to actually use them in real apps. I've recently set a goal for myself of becoming a "better" React developer. By better, I mean being more aware everything the language has to offer (hooks, contextAPI, life cycle methods, etc...), and being able to use them to solve problems more efficiently. For each project I will tracking how long it took to complete in days and hours. Following the completion of each app in this series I will giving a small description of the concepts applied, a bit of the strategy/logic employed, and any hardships faced/overcome.
